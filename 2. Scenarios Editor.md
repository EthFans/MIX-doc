Scenarios can be used to test and debug contracts.

方案(Scenario) 可以用来测试和 debug 合约。

A scenario is effectively a local blockchain where blocks can be mined without PoW – otherwise testing would be quite slow ;).

一个方案(Scenario)是一个本地的区块链，里面的区块可以在没有 PoW 的情况下被挖矿——否则会导致测试起来很慢;)。

A scenario consists of a sequence of transactions. Usually, a scenario would start with the contract creation scenarios of the dapp. In addition, further transactions can be added to test and debug the dapp. Scenarios can be modified, i.e. transactions can be removed. Note that a scenario needs to be rebuilt for modifications to become effective. Further testing can be done using local JS calls via the JS API.

一个方案(Scenario)包含一系列交易。一般来说，一个方案(Scenario)从 dapp 的合约创建方案开始。另外，可以添加更多的交易，以对dapp进行测试和 debug。方案(Scenario)可以进行更改，例如移除一个交易。注意，为了使改动生效，需要重新 build 方案(Scenario)。通过 JS API 的本地 JS 调用，可以进行进一步的测试。

In case it’s not open, access the scenario and debugger pane by pressing F7 or Windows > Show right or the debug button in the upper right corner of the main window.

如果进入方案和 debugger 面板没有显示，通过按下 F7 或 Windos > Show right 或主界面右上角的 debug 按钮，可以打开它们。

Creating and setting up a new scenario

When you launch Mix for the first time, an empty scenario, i.e. not containing any transactions, will be created. Add an account named “MyAccount” and set it’s initial balance to 1 ether. Click OK. Rename the scenario to “Deploy”.

Modifying initial ether balance of an account

Actually, we want to do a lot of tests Edit the Genesis block parameters and set your initial account balance to 1000 ether. Rebuild the scenario for the change to become effective.

Rebuilding a scenario

Each time a transaction is modified or an account added, the scenario has to be rebuilt for modifications to become effective. Note that if a scenario is rebuilt the web frontend (local storage) may also need to be reset (this is not done automatically be Mix).

Creating a transaction

Let’s get some ether sent to Bob. Create another account named “Bob” with zero ether balance. Create a new transaction in the scenario pane. Click “Add Tx…” and send 300 ether to Bob. Add a block.

Altering and reusing scenarios

Create a new scenario or start from a scenario with several transactions that you duplicate first

Rename the scenario

Modify scenario by specifying transactions that shall be removed

Rebuild the scenario

Display calls

A contract call is a function invokation. This is not a transaction as a contract call cannot change the state. A contract call is not part of the blockchain but for practical and ux design reason, it is convenient to display calls at the same functional level as a transaction. The JS icon warn you that this is not a transaction but a call. To show/hide call, click on the menu Scenario -> Display calls.
